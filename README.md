#Frieze Group Visualization

A computer program by Marielle Foster exploring Abstract Algebra vizualizations

Uses a simple graphics program (graphics.py) by John Zelle to vizualize the patterns.

To run, type "python frieze.py" or "python3 frieze.py" (works with both python 3 and python 2.7)

It will prompt you for:
	1) How many points you want in your polygon
	2) Where those points fall inside the box (to make your "pattern")
	3) How big of a translation you want between patterns
	
	
#About Frieze Groups

There are seven unique types of frieze groups.

###I: translation 
(isomorphic to the integers)

###II: glide reflection 
(isomorphic to the integers)

###III: translation and vertical reflection 
(isomorphic to the infinite dihedral group)

###IV: translation and rotation of 180 degrees 
(isomorphic to the infinite dihedral group)

###V: glide reflection and rotation of 180 degrees 
(isomorphic to the infinite dihedral group)

###VI: translation and horizontal reflection 
(isomorphic to the direct product of Z and Z/2Z)


###VII: translation, horizontal reflection and vertical reflection 
(isomorphic to the direct product of Z/2Z and the infinite dihedral group)
